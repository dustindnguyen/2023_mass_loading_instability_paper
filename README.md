This repository contains the source code of _Cholla_ alongside various Jupyter notebooks used to make many of the plots in the paper. 
The data files exceed the maximum allowed file upload and are not included. However, the notebooks can be used as a guide for manipulating Cholla data files and showcase my own analysis. 

Please note the _Cholla_ version is outdated. The current version of _Cholla_ can be an order of magnitude faster than the version here. The main differences between this version and the main branch is that everything on the main branch is coded in CUDA whereas here problems are coded in C++ (see /src/cc85.cpp for my modifications for this paper).
